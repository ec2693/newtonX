I have used play framework starter java project to build this application and MySQL database

Database config are defined in configuration/application.conf i.e databaseName, userName and password, need to comment out the in-memory config and uncomment mySQL config.

Three routes have been defined in the route file and can be tested using postman, on localhost:9000

Project can be compile and run using "sbt compile run"

Used gson library to convert POST body json to user model and serialize the user object to send in response for GET Apis.
